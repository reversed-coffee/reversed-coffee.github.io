This project is the very website you're looking at right now! I developed this website in 2024 using
[Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator (SSG) that allows me to write my
website in a mix of HTML, CSS/[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and
JavaScript/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) without having to complexify the
workflow.

Working on frontend development is typically not my strong suit, but I wanted to challenge myself to develop a website
from scratch. I just never enjoyed frontend technologies because it's less about solving problems and more about making
things look pretty.

However, I wanted to have a blog, so I needed to start somewhere. Astro is a great tool for me to start with because it
allows me to write my website in a way that I'm comfortable with.

This website source code is available on
