This was a project that I developed in 2023 to qualify my team for the "Software Engineering Team" competition at
Business Professionals of America. This project got half of the members on the team into the National Leadership
Conference in Chicago, Illinois.

The project was a solid base engine for a video game that could be built upon. The engine was developed in C++ and was
designed to be cross-platform. The project is available as an archive on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ttr-cyber-2023-bpa-v03/clockwork-eclipse-engine/). Two notable
dependencies of the project were [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and
[oneTBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB), which were used for rendering and threading,
respectively.

We ended up moving to a different implementation that was built into the browser. This was because the team was more
comfortable with web development than C++. Our team placed 10th in the nation, but lessons were learned. If we were to
do this project again, we would have started with the web implementation from the start and would have managed our time
better.
