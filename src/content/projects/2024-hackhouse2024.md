[Check out my blog post that features this project!](/blog/typosquatting-danger-hidden-in-plain-sight)

hackhouse2024 was a project that I worked on with a few classmates in 2024. The project was developed to educate the
public on the dangers of typosquatting.

I was the project lead, and I was responsible for the overall direction of the project. I contributed a significant
portion of the codebase, and I was responsible for the deployment of the live demonstration. The repository for the
live demonstration and supplemental information can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/reversed-coffee/hackhouse2024).

All of us worked together to develop the ideas, design, and implementation of the project over the course of a few
weeks. The project ended up being a success, and we were able to educate a lot of people on the dangers of
typosquatting. We presented the project at a local event at our school that was open to students, industry partners, and
the public.
